/**
 * The Romanian county codes the catalogue filters by.

 * The catalogue's own documentation shows a county being given by name (`judet: "Bihor"`), and
 * that returns nothing: the filter is an exact, case-sensitive match on the two-letter code, so
 * `Bihor` and `bh` both find no caves at all. A free-text box would therefore be a box in which
 * almost everything typed is silently wrong, which is why this is a list to choose from.
 *
 * The names are here only to make the list readable; only the code is ever sent.
