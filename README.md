# SilexGIS

Web application for storage and view of topographic, geographic and other associated cave and karst data.

Since May 2022 the application is being rebuilt from scratch using modern technologies: React, TypeScript, PostgreSQL / PostGIS, Laravel (PHP framework), OpenLayers 6. In the current state, only part of the functionality of the initial application is reimplemented.
